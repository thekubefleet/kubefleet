🚀 **Excited to share Kubefleet - A Modern Kubernetes Monitoring & Management Platform!**

I've been working on an open-source project that I believe will help DevOps teams and Kubernetes administrators better understand and manage their clusters. 

**What is Kubefleet?**
Kubefleet is a comprehensive Kubernetes monitoring and management platform that provides real-time insights into your cluster health, resource utilization, and performance metrics through an intuitive dashboard interface.

**Key Features:**
✅ **Real-time Monitoring** - Live metrics and health status across your entire cluster
✅ **Resource Analytics** - Detailed CPU, memory, and storage utilization tracking  
✅ **Namespace Management** - Easy overview and management of all namespaces
✅ **Modern UI** - Beautiful React-based dashboard with Material-UI components
✅ **gRPC Architecture** - High-performance communication between agent and dashboard
✅ **Kubernetes Native** - Deploy directly to your cluster with provided manifests

**Tech Stack:**
• **Backend**: Go with gRPC for high-performance data streaming
• **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Material-UI for modern UX
• **Charts**: Recharts for beautiful data visualization
• **Deployment**: Docker containers with Kubernetes manifests

**Why I Built This:**
Managing Kubernetes clusters can be complex and time-consuming. I wanted to create a tool that provides immediate visibility into cluster health while being easy to deploy and use. The goal is to help teams spend less time troubleshooting and more time building great applications.
